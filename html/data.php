//convert the $animalsJSON into a PHP variable with json_decod and store it into $animals.  be sure to give it a second variable of true to decode it into associative arrays rather than php standard objects
//we don't need to do this normally, we're having fun with php!  loading in data via json!

//very similar to the JS sort function, don't you think?

//encode the data back into json with json_encode into the variable $sortedAnimals
